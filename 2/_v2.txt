Jade, Gulp

Introducing Jade, Gulp, Node.js,
How Gulp is different from Grunt:


Both work by using "plug-ins", but they are configured differently:

Grunt works by feeding it a huge set of configuration options, including options for plug-ins, then simply starting it up and letting it do it's thing.
( configuration over code )

Gulp works by requiring you to build your own "pipeline" by wiring together the various plug-ins that you will use.  Every plug-in uses the Node.js "stream" system to efficently process files in-memory before writing the results to disk.
( code over configuration )

Think of a very old IBM computer,
just a huge gray box
you push in a punch-card
and it starts to do it's thing.
That's Grunt.

Now, think of an old telephone switchboard,
where ladies with headphones manipulate cables and plugs.
Any cable can be connected by simply plugging it in.
That is Gulp.
